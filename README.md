# Premise Boxes #

A box allows you to wrap content from the WYSIWYG editor within a 'div' and place into your site content. You can add your own classes and id which enables you to build markup quickly.

If you use a framework like Premise WP or Bootstrap, you can apply classes from said framework and easily structure your content in the front end.

Support to insert Boxes within Boxes will be coming soon as well the ability to add more than 'div' elements.

## Changelog

* **v2.0.0**
	* On version 2 we changed everything. We were trying to do too much with version one supporting too many elements to be inserted and although it was usefull, it was not well thought out and design. Version 2 does one thing, but does it right, it inserts a div with content into your site. That's it. We will add support for all other feature again later but better!
