# Premise Boxes #

### Description

This plugin is an attempt at reducing the gap there is between developers and project/content managers. The idea is to provide a UI that is user friendly for the ones who do not code, yet offer a code editor for developers who sometimes feel it is easier to make changes writing code. The concept is simple: You can insert content using the WYSIWYG eiditor but wrap that content with custom HTML. This is where the gap with developers gets shorten! Premise Boxes offers a code editor that allows developers to enter HTML code and use the variable %%CONTENT%% to insert the content from the Project/Content manager into the markup. It allows for both sides to work togehter and support each other!

This plugin only loads styles and scripts in the backend (when creating or editing a post). It currently does not bind any styles or scripts to the front end.

**Important**: Premise Boxes does not do any HTML validation for you. It is important to trust the people that are using this plugin or have access to it.

### Uses CodeMirror

CodeMirror is a in-browser code editor. We use it on the code editor for developers. To learn more about it [click here](http://codemirror.com/).
